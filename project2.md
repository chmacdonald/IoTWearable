***1. Who is the audience for your project? (Who will benefit from its existence):***
People who park in crowded garages

***2. Provide a brief description of your general concept (questions 5-8 provide an opportunity for further explanation of specific aspects of the concept):***
A system that locates and directs indiviuals to open spaces in crowded parking garages.

***3. Provide a few (2-5) brief, informal user stories:***
Mall parking garages on a crowded weekend can look more like a battle field than a parking garage.  With people fighting for spots and everyone stressed over not being able to find a spot, it makes the mall a lot less fun when you should be on a nice relaxing weekend.

***4. Will the costs to develop, deploy, and maintain your project provide enough value (convenience, safety, etc.) to be significant for the audience?  Provide some justification that your project's benefit will outweigh the "costs" (time, money, etc.) for the audience:***
This may seem to be not that big of a problem, but the cost of this issue is not the high.  In the scale of the world, this is a very minor problem, but I am tired of having to drive around for 20 minutes looking for a spot.

***5. What hardware would be needed for your project?***
We would need a few IR sensors and some read and blue leds.



***6. Explain how an embedded system ("thing(s)") is vital to this work:***
There needs to be a network of sensors that send information back to be collected and then display where the open spaces are and then make sure to show that the space has been taken.

***7. Explain the role of a graphical user interface to this work:***
The GUI would lead the driver to the location of the spot.

***8. Explain the role of networking to this work:***
The network would be among all of the IR sensors at each spot that read if there is a car or not.

***9. Does this idea meet all requirements:***

- [X] One or more embedded devices
- [X] Use of sensors and feedback
- [X] Graphical user interface for some features
- [X] Well motivated use of networking.
