***1. Who is the audience for your project? (Who will benefit from its existence):***
People suffering from alzheimer's disease and their families.

***2. Provide a brief description of your general concept (questions 5-8 provide an opportunity for further explanation of specific aspects of the concept):***
Will be a tracking device and a vitals tracker wearable for individuals suffering from alzheimer's disease who are at high risk to get lost and hurt themselves.
***3. Provide a few (2-5) brief, informal user stories:***
When I was younger, my grandmother who was suffering from alzheimer's escaped out of her care facility.  She ended up in a car with a women she didn't know 45 minutes away.  It took them hours to locate my grandmother which worried my father and his siblings.  Our project aims to help fix this.

***4. Will the costs to develop, deploy, and maintain your project provide enough value (convenience, safety, etc.) to be significant for the audience?  Provide some justification that your project's benefit will outweigh the "costs" (time, money, etc.) for the audience:***
Yes, the cost to develope, deploy, and maintain our project will be worth it, because this solution will be used everyday by people who cannot help themselves in many instances.

***5. What hardware would be needed for your project?***
We will need a GPS tracker, maybe a gyroscope or vibration sensors to detect falls, temperature sensor, perhaps a heartbeat sensor.

***6. Explain how an embedded system ("thing(s)") is vital to this work:***
The needs to be sensors and a tracking device on the person at all times and set to a centeral location that is excessable to all parties involved.

***7. Explain the role of a graphical user interface to this work:***
The GUI would be a map with the persons location and the vitals of the person.

***8. Explain the role of networking to this work:***
The network would need to be cellular or function of a cell phones ability to transmit a wifi signal so that the device is trackable when away from traditional wifi.

***9. Does this idea meet all requirements:***

- [X] One or more embedded devices
- [X] Use of sensors and feedback
- [X] Graphical user interface for some features
- [X] Well motivated use of networking.
