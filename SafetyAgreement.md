# Safety First!

1. ***Safety to people is paramount!!!***
1. Protecting hardware is also important. **Damaged hardware is not grounds for extensions to due dates!**

# Each member of the team should read and agree to the following by entering their name in the table below:

- I will always use parts in the way intended and within intended operating ranges (voltages, currents, temperatures, etc.).
- I will double check circuits before applying power.
- I will not leave circuits powered when not attended.
- I will carefully consider current and voltage in all circuits (and the impact of current and voltage on all parts of the circuit).
- I will not allow my project to operate without supervision until the design and implementation have been reviewed by the instructor or a third party approved by the instructor.
- If I use any additional power supplies (something more than a single USB power supply cable to the Photon or a single 4AA battery pack) or interact with higher power devices/appliances, I will:
  - Have my electrical design, mechanical design, and actual wiring reviewed and approved by the instructor (or approved third party) prior to testing it.
  - Thoroughly test my code using simpler hardware (lights, print statements, etc.) and have my code reviewed by the instructor (or approved third party) before testing it on the actual hardware.
- If my project requires interaction with liquids, I will have the project reviewed by the instructor (or approved third party) before testing it with liquids.
- I understand that my grade may be penalized for disregarding the above.
- I am aware that the project is primarily a proof-of-concept and that there are no requirements to use exotic hardware or power supplies.
- As I develop my project I will try to ensure that my work does not pose a healthy or safety risk to myself or others.  When in doubt, I will seek clarifications about potential risks.

Each member of the team should type their full name in the appropriate slot of the table to acknowledge agreement:
